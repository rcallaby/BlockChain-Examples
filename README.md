# BlockChain-Examples

## Created by Richard Callaby

Follow me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/rcallaby) to see what projects or tutorials I am currently working on!  

The purpose of this GitHub is to showcase some of my projects that I am currently working on. This repository showcases the various ways BlockChains can be implemented. Many of the videos on my channel will explain the logic and reasoning behind what I am doing on GitHub. Of course there will be also a article on the explaination on my personal website which is mentioned below.

Not only am I a software developer but I am also a [published Kindle author](http://amazon.com/author/richardcallaby
) as well as an [Udemy Instructor](https://www.udemy.com/user/richardcallaby/).

There will be or should be in the future youtube tutorials for each and every one of these files. Be sure to check out the channel for the updates which should be cominng very soon.

I have numerous interests besides software development, but obviously, my software projects will be showcased on GitHub for all to enjoy!

If you want to see what else I am into be sure to find me on the Kindle marketplace or visit me on my [personal website](https://richardcallaby.com)
